idea: starting point of nodes mining blocks and broadcasting new state across the network.
- new block mined when block hash has leading zeroes
- when new blockchain received, compare to length of current chain

v1.1: need a refresher on socket programming. simplify to sender and receiver.
- sender runs a loop waiting for user input and sends bytes to the receiver.
- receiver runs a loop waiting for message and prints bytes.

v1.2: convert sender to HQ and receiver to node. HQ broadcasts to all nodes in network.
- HQ runs a loop waiting for user input and sends bytes to all nodes.
- receiver initialized with specific port, runs a loop waiting for message and prints bytes.
