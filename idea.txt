idea: starting point of nodes randomly generating new blocks and broadcasting state across network.
- new block generated every 10 seconds, awarded randomly among participants
- network participant list locked 1 second before award
- broadcast to network at each award, inconsistency crashes network

v1.1: need a refresher on socket programming. simplify to sender and receiver.
- sender runs a loop waiting for user input and sends bytes to the receiver.
- receiver runs a loop waiting for message and prints bytes.

v1.2: convert sender to HQ and receiver to node. HQ broadcasts to all nodes in network.
- HQ runs a loop waiting for user input and sends bytes to all nodes.
- receiver initialized with specific port, runs a loop waiting for message and prints bytes.
