idea: starting point of nodes mining blocks and broadcasting new state across the network.
- new block mined when proof-of-work satisfied i.e. block hash has 4 leading zeroes
- when new blockchain received, validate blockchain and compare to length of current chain

v1.1: need a refresher on socket programming. simplify to sender and receiver.
- sender runs a loop waiting for user input and sends bytes to the receiver.
- receiver runs a loop waiting for message and prints bytes.

v1.2: convert sender to HQ and receiver to node. HQ broadcasts to all nodes in network.
- HQ runs a loop waiting for user input and sends bytes to all nodes.
- node initialized with specific port, runs a loop waiting for message and prints bytes.

v1.3: single node mining.
- node iterates through 1000 nonce values at a time, appends to blockchain when found and
  broadcasts full chain to the network.
- node listens for 1 second in between 1000 iterations.

v1.4: single node mining and validation.
- node validates blockchain received satisfy proof-of-work and indeed form a chain.
- node replaces with current blockchain when valid and is longer.

idea: implement transactions by declaring hash address where token received, sender and receiver.
- determination of blockchain or message by size
- transactions stored in a buffer while mining
